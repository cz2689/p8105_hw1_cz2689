# Problem 1
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
view (penguins)
skimr::skim(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
```
This data set is called penguins, and it includes variables: species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, and year. This data set has 344 rows and 8 columns. 
And the mean flipper length is 200.92 according to the 'skimr' function. 

## Plot the penguins data

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) + geom_point()
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 6, width = 6)
```
