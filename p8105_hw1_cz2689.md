# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This data set is called `penguins`, and it includes variables:
bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, island,
sex, species, year. This data set has 344 rows and 8 columns. And the
mean flipper length of the penguins is 200.9152047 mm.

## Plot the penguins data

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem 2

``` r
p2 = tibble(
  norm = rnorm(10),
  logi = norm > 0,
  char = c("a","b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  fact = factor(c("t", "m", "b", "t", "m", "b", "t", "m", "b", "m"))
  )
p2
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##       norm logi  char  fact 
    ##      <dbl> <lgl> <chr> <fct>
    ##  1  0.404  TRUE  a     t    
    ##  2  0.0601 TRUE  b     m    
    ##  3  0.837  TRUE  c     b    
    ##  4  1.10   TRUE  d     t    
    ##  5 -0.244  FALSE e     m    
    ##  6  0.185  TRUE  f     b    
    ##  7  0.205  TRUE  g     t    
    ##  8  1.51   TRUE  h     m    
    ##  9  0.372  TRUE  i     b    
    ## 10  0.228  TRUE  j     m

## Taking the mean of each variable

``` r
a = pull(p2, var = norm)
mean(a)
```

    ## [1] 0.4666064

``` r
b = pull(p2, var = logi)
mean(b)
```

    ## [1] 0.9

``` r
c = pull(p2, var = char)
mean(c)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(c): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
d = pull(p2, var = fact)
mean(d)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(d): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

As we can see from the output, we can compute mean for only numeric and
logical vector but not for character and factor vector.

## As.numeric function

``` r
e = as.numeric(b)

f = as.numeric(c)

g = as.numeric(d)
```

From the environment, we can see that logical variables were forced into
1 and 0 (standard computer language for true and false), character
variables were forced into N/A (make sense), and factor variables were
forced into integer 1, 2, 3 (some underlying levels). It explain why we
can take the mean of logical variables since this mean represent how
many true and false values there are. We can not take the mean of
character variables since they are N/A. For factor variables, it does
not make sense to take the average. Those level are not what we
assigned. It might not reflect the ture levels we want. However, it is
possible to take the mean after the coercion for factor variables.
